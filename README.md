Move: A and D or Left and Right.

Jump: Space or UP

R to restart the level.

Wall Jumping:

-The basic wall jump triggers if you're already hanging on a wall and you press jump. No directional input necessary.

-The hyper wall jump triggers if you press jump while you're in the air. If you initiated the hyper wall jump close enough to a wall, you'll spring off of it with more force than the basic one. If you initiate it too far from a wall, your feet will fly out from under you and you'll fall!
